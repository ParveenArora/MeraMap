<h1>Meramap-Api - What it Does</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Meramap-api is a debian package to install an 
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> API Server, also known as the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Rails_port">Rails Port</a>.
Note that this means it is installing a copy of the OpenStreetMap Web Site, and the database interface to allow editing of OpenStreetMap Data stored locally on your own server.   It does NOT generate map tiles to display on web pages - for that you need meramap.deb, not meramap-api.deb.
